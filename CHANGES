Logbook Changelog
=================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Logbook release.

Version 0.4
-----------

Released on October 24th.  Codename "Phoenix"

- Added preliminary RabbitMQ and CouchDB support.
- Added :class:`logbook.notifiers.NotifoHandler`
- `channel` is now documented to be used for filtering purposes if
  wanted.  Previously this was an opaque string that was not intended
  for filtering of any kind.

Version 0.3
-----------

Released on October 23rd.  Codename "Informant"

- Added :class:`logbook.more.ColorizingStreamHandlerMixin` and
  :class:`logbook.more.ColorizedStderrHandler`
- Deprecated :class:`logbook.RotatingFileHandlerBase` because the
  interface was not flexible enough.
- Provided basic Python 3 compatibility.  This did cause a few smaller
  API changes that caused minimal changes on Python 2 as well.  The
  deprecation of the :class:`logbook.RotatingFileHandlerBase` was a
  result of this.
- Added support for Python 2.4
- Added batch emitting support for handlers which now makes it possible
  to use the :class:`logbook.more.FingersCrossedHandler` with the
  :class:`logbook.MailHandler`.
- Moved the :class:`~logbook.FingersCrossedHandler` handler into the
  base package.  The old location stays importable for a few releases.
- Added :class:`logbook.GroupHandler` that buffers records until the
  handler is popped.
- Added :class:`logbook.more.ExternalApplicationHandler` that executes
  an external application for each log record emitted.

Version 0.2.1
-------------

Bugfix release, Released on September 22nd.

- Fixes Python 2.5 compatibility.

Version 0.2
-----------

Released on September 21st.  Codename "Walls of Text"

- Implemented default with statement for handlers which is an
  alias for `threadbound`.
- `applicationbound` and `threadbound` return the handler now.
- Implemented channel recording on the log records.
- The :class:`logbook.more.FingersCrossedHandler` now is set to
  `ERROR` by default and has the ability to create new loggers
  from a factory function.
- Implemented maximum buffer size for the
  :class:`logbook.more.FingersCrossedHandler` as well as a lock
  for thread safety.
- Added ability to filter for context.
- Moved bubbling flags and filters to the handler object.
- Moved context processors on their own stack.
- Removed the `iter_context_handlers` function.
- Renamed `NestedHandlerSetup` to :class:`~logbook.NestedSetup`
  because it can now also configure processors.
- Added the :class:`logbook.Processor` class.
- There is no difference between logger attached handlers and
  context specific handlers any more.
- Added a function to redirect warnings to logbook
  (:func:`logbook.compat.redirected_warnings`).
- Fixed and improved :class:`logbook.LoggerGroup`.
- The :class:`logbook.TestHandler` now keeps the record open
  for further inspection.
- The traceback is now removed from a log record when the record
  is closed.  The formatted traceback is a cached property
  instead of a function.
- Added ticketing handlers that send logs directly into a database.
- Added MongoDB backend for ticketing handlers
- Added a :func:`logbook.base.dispatch_record` function to dispatch
  records to handlers independently of a logger (uses the default
  record dispatching logic).
- Renamed `logger_name` to `channel`.
- Added a multi processing log handler
  (:class:`logbook.more.MultiProcessingHandler`).
- Added a twitter handler.
- Added a ZeroMQ handler.
- Added a Growl handler.
- Added a Libnotify handler.
- Added a monitoring file handler.
- Added a handler wrapper that moves the actual handling into a
  background thread.
- The mail handler can now be configured to deliver each log record
  not more than n times in m seconds.
- Added support for Python 2.5
- Added a :class:`logbook.queues.SubscriberGroup` to deal with multiple
  subscribers.
- Added a :class:`logbook.compat.LoggingHandler` for redirecting logbook
  log calls to the standard library's :mod:`logging` module.
